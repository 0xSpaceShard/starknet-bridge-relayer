# Starknet Bridge Relayer
Starknet Relay is a service that consumes Starknet withdrawals on L1. When the user bridges the tokens from L2 to L1, it is possible to automate the process of withdrawing the tokens on L1 by paying the gas fee on L2 to the wallet relayer. The relayer will detect that the user did the payment and then calls the withdrawal function when the message reaches L1.
